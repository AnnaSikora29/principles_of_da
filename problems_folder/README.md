# Problems 

This folder contains my completed solutions for the assignment tasks based on the UCI Wine dataset.

## Problem 1: Load and Explore the Wine Dataset

Import the Wine dataset using sklearn.datasets.load_wine(). Explain, in your own words, what the function returns. In particular, describe:

- The shape of the dataset;
- The first and last 3 rows;
- The feature names and their meaning;
- The target class labels.

## Problem 2: Summary Statistics

Compute and display the following for each feature:

- Mean
- Range (max - min)
- Standard deviation
- Median
- Inter-quartile range

Use any numpy or pandas functions as needed.

## Problem 3: Visualizing Distributions

Create histograms of any four features. Make sure to label the axes and add a title to each plot.

## Problem 4: Exploring Relationships

Choose any two different features and create a scatter plot using matplotlib. Use different colours for each class. Try to select the two features that have the most interesting relationship. Remember to show your reasoning and include any code you write.

## Problem 5: Correlation
Fit a regression line to the scatterplot from Problem 4. Calculate the 
*R²* value and display it on the plot.
